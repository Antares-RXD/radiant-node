# Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 23.1.0

Bitcoin Cash Node version 23.1.0 is now available from:

  <https://bitcoincashnode.org>

## Overview

This is a minor release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) containing several minor bugfixes and some performance improvements, such as:

- Mempool: 40% performance speedup in removing confirmed txs and multiple speedups for other operations as well.
- Mempool: removal of all pre-May 15 2021 logic and data structures, including structures dealing with unconfirmed ancestor limits, saving memory and CPU cycles.
- Scalenet: Ensure the "disconnected block transactions" pool has enough memory.
- Added the JSON-RPC command: `getdsproofscore`.
- Save known DSProofs across restarts to `dsproofs.dat`.
- Fixed misspelling of "hexstring" param name in the "signrawtransactionwithwallet" method.
- Fix bug where `-txbroadcastinterval=0` would lead to a numerical singularity where no txs were sent. Instead, with this arg at 0, txs are now just sent as quickly as possible.
- Remove `-tachyonactivationtime` from CLI args & consensus rules.
- DSProofs: Bug fix where sometimes nodes would "discourage" each other incorrectly after they clean up expired proofs.
- Mining: Add `-gbtcheckvalidity` arg to CLI; `"checkvalidity"` arg to GBT/GBTL.
- Mining: Fix potential crash in `submitblock` if 2 RPC threads are submitting a block simultaneously.
- Speedup to block validation and tx validation by removing a redundant map lookup when checking inputs.

## Usage recommendations

Users who are running v22.x.x or earlier are strongly urged to upgrade to v23.1.0, since the v22 series (and previous) do not implement the recent [May 15, 2021 Network Upgrade](https://upgradespecs.bitcoincashnode.org/2021-05-15-upgrade/).  Users running v23.0.0 may also wish to upgrade to this version, since it does improve performance and does fix some minor bugs.


## Network changes

A minor bug has been corrected where in some corner cases P2P nodes may end up "discouraging" each other incorrectly when an old DSProof is removed after a block is confirmed.


## Added functionality

- Double-spend proofs now are persisted across restarts to a file in the data directory called `dsproofs.dat`. The mechanism for this is similar to how the mempool is already persisted across restarts. Double-spend proofs are not persisted if the node was started with `-persistmempool=0` or `-doublespendproof=0`.

### `gbtcheckvalidity` configuration option and `checkvalidity` RPC arg

This new command-line option (as well as its counterpart RPC arg) may be of interest to miners. With `-gbtcheckvalidity=0` (or RPC arg `checkvalidity=false` to the `getblocktemplate`/`getblocktemplatelight` RPC), all validity checks on a new block template are skipped. This saves significant time in generating a new block template (50% or greater speedup for large blocks).

The validity checks are redundant "belt-and-suspenders" checks -- and it should never be the case that this codebase produces an "invalid" block in `getblocktemplate`. Producing an invalid block that fails these checks would be a serious bug in this codebase. As such, these checks can be optionally skipped for the intrepid miner wishing to maximize performance and minimize latency to `getblocktemplate` and/or `getblocktemplatelight`.

The default for these options is to preserve the status-quo (default: `-gbtcheckvalidity=1` and/or `checkvalidity=true` to the RPC), and perform these (redundant) validity checks on new block templates.

## Deprecated functionality

In the `getmempoolentry` RPC call, the verbose modes of the `getrawmempool`/`getmempoolancestors`/`getmempooldescendants` RPC calls, and the JSON mode of the mempool REST call, the `height` field is deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release. This field indicates the block height upon mempool acceptance.

The `bip125-replaceable` field in the result of `gettransaction` is deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release.

The `arc lint` linting is deprecated and developers should use the `ninja check-lint` target instead.

## Modified functionality

The CLI/conf arg `-txbroadcastinterval=0` would previously lead to a situation where the node would never relay transactions. This is considered a bug and has been corrected. Now, if the node operator specifies `-txbroadcastinterval=0`, the node relays transactions as quickly as possible.

## Removed functionality

The CLI arg `-tachyonactivationtime` has been removed. All relay rules behave as if "tachyon" (the internal name for the May 15, 2021 network upgrade) has always been active.

The following CLI args (all related to the now-removed ancestor limit) have been removed: `-walletrejectlongchains`, `-limitdescendantcount`, `-limitancestorcount`, `-limitdescendantsize`, `-limitancestorsize`.

## New RPC methods

### `getdsproofscore`

`getdsproofscore` returns a double-spend confidence score for a mempool transaction.

This new method should help merchant or wallet server implementors quickly decide if a transaction is reliable for 0-conf (1.0: has no DSProofs and is eligible for DSProof mechanism), or is unreliable for 0-conf (<1.0: has DSProofs, or is ineligible for the DSProof mechanism, or has a very long ancestor chain).

Please refer to the documentation pages for [getdsproofscore](https://docs.bitcoincashnode.org/doc/json-rpc/getdsproofscore/) for details about additional arguments and the returned data.

## Low-level RPC changes

The `getmempoolancestors` and `getmempooldescendants` RPC methods now return a list of transactions that are sorted topologically (with parents coming before children). Previously they were sorted by transaction ID.

Mempool entries from the verbose versions of: `getrawmempool`, `getmempoolentry`, `getmempoolancestors`, and `getmempooldescendants` which contain a `spentby` key now have the transactions in the `spentby` list sorted topologically (with parents coming before children). Previously this list was sorted by transaction ID.

The `getblocktemplate` and `getblocktemplatelight` template-request dictionary now accepts an additional key: `checkvalidity` (default if unspecified: true). If set to false, then validity checks for the generated block template are skipped (thus leading to a faster return from the RPC call).

## User interface changes

Bitcoin Cash Node 23.1.0 does not introduce any user interface changes as compared to 23.0.0.

## Regressions

Bitcoin Cash Node 23.1.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 23.0.0.

## Known Issues

Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.

- MacOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported. Additionally,
  Bitcoin Cash Node does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode"
  is activated.

- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt
  or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.
  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same
  wallet folder.

- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL
  environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a
  supported environment for the software. This may change in future.

  The functional failure on WSL is tracked in Issue #33.
  It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from
  opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with
  the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption.
  The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.

- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision (Issue #65).

- `test_bitcoin` can collide with temporary files if used by more than
  one user on the same system simultaneously. (Issue #43)

- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than
  the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration
  the database format compatibility issues described in Issue #34.
  When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this
  avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.

- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20
  (see Issue #144). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning
  of the BCHN software on that platform.

- An 'autotools' build (the old build method) fails on OSX when using Clang.
  (Issue #129)

- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling
  the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous
  linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted (Issue #138).

- The 'autotools' build is known to require some workarounds in order to
  use the 'fuzzing' build feature (Issue #127).

- Some functional tests are known to fail spuriously with varying probability.
  (see e.g. issue #148, and a fuller listing in #162).

- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize
  value (Issue #156)

- There are obstacles building the current version on Ubuntu 16.04 (see #187).
  These are worked around by our packaging system, but users trying to build
  the software from scratch are advised to either upgrade to more recent Ubuntu,
  or retrofit the necessary toolchains and perform the same build steps for
  Xenial as registered in our packaging repository, or build in a VM using
  the gitian build instructions, or run our reproducible binary release builds.
  There is ongoing work on the build system to address underlying issues,
  but the related code changes were not ready in time for the v23.0.0 release.

- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for
  around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them
  (see #210).

- In the `getmempoolentry` RPC call, the verbose modes of the
  `getrawmempool`/`getmempoolancestors`/`getmempooldescendants` RPC calls, and
  the JSON mode of the mempool REST call, the `height` field shows an incorrect
  block height after a node restart. Note the field is deprecated and will be
  removed in a subsequent release.

- On some platforms, the splash screen can be maximized, but it cannot be
  unmaximized again (see #255). This has only been observed on Mac OSX,
  not on Linux or Windows builds.
